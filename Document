Tomato Leaf Disease Detection - Project Documentation
1. Introduction
This project is a web-based Tomato Leaf Disease Detection System developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model integrated into a Flask web application. The user uploads an image of a tomato leaf, and the system predicts the disease present in the leaf.
2. Project Structure
The following is the folder structure of the project:

3. Description of Project Files
app.py
Main application file for Flask. Loads the CNN model, processes uploaded images, predicts disease, and renders HTML templates.
Training/tomato_leaf_disease_model.h5
Pre-trained CNN model saved using Keras. Used for inference (prediction) in the Flask app.
templates/index.html
Homepage that provides an upload form for users to submit tomato leaf images.
templates/result.html
Displays the prediction result along with the uploaded image.
static/uploads/
Stores uploaded images temporarily to be displayed back to the user.
static/style.css
Contains CSS styles for HTML pages. Optional but improves UI presentation.
requirements.txt
Lists all Python libraries required to run the project. Can be installed using pip.
README.md
Contains project overview, setup instructions, model classes, and usage details.
4. Supported Disease Classes
The model is trained to detect the following tomato leaf conditions:
Tomato___Bacterial_spot
Tomato___Early_blight
Tomato___Late_blight
Tomato___Leaf_Mold
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot
Tomato___Spider_mites
Tomato___Target_Spot
Tomato___Tomato_YellowLeaf_Curl_Virus
Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus
Tomato___healthy
5. How to Run the Project
1. Clone the project folder.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Flask application using: python app.py
5. Open a browser and navigate to: http://localhost:7000
